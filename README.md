The diminishing availability of conventional petroleum resources has spurred the exploration of alternative fuels for internal combustion engines. Among the various options available, fuels derived from vegetable oils and animal fats emerge as promising "greener" alternatives to fossil fuels. These vegetable oils can significantly lower net CO2 emissions while also contributing to the reduction of petroleum product imports. To enhance engine performance, optimize combustion, and manage emissions from compression ignition (CI) engines, common rail direct injection (CRDI) technology provides extensive opportunities by allowing precise control over fuel injection parameters, including fuel injection pressure, start of injection (SOI) timing, fuel injection rate, and injection duration. The fuel ignition pressure is set at 400 bar at 500 rpm, and experiments are conducted using various blends of lemon peel diesel to assess performance and emissions.
